Project Review: Stream notify on Bluesky

1\. Core Application Logic

main.py:

Role: Main entry point of the application. Orchestrates the overall
functionality. Functionality: Initializes and runs a Flask web server
(using waitress for production). Handles application setup: loads
configuration, sets up logging, validates settings. Manages the
Cloudflare tunnel lifecycle (start/stop) via tunnel.py. Handles Twitch
EventSub webhook interactions: Defines a /webhook endpoint for GET
(health check) and POST (notifications). Verifies incoming webhook
signatures (eventsub.verify_signature). Processes
webhook_callback_verification challenges from Twitch. Processes
notification messages for stream.online and stream.offline events. For
stream.online: Extracts stream details (title, category) and uses
BlueskyPoster to post to Bluesky. For stream.offline: Uses BlueskyPoster
to post an offline notification to Bluesky. Supports enabling/disabling
online/offline notifications via NOTIFY_ON_ONLINE/NOTIFY_ON_OFFLINE
environment variables. Logs revocation messages from Twitch. Manages
Twitch EventSub subscriptions: cleans up old ones and creates new ones
for desired events (eventsub.cleanup_eventsub_subscriptions,
eventsub.create_eventsub_subscription). Handles WEBHOOK_SECRET rotation
(utils.rotate_secret_if_needed). Ensures TWITCH_BROADCASTER_ID is a
numeric ID (eventsub.setup_broadcaster_id). Key Technologies: Flask,
Waitress. eventsub.py:

Role: Manages all interactions with the Twitch EventSub system and
Twitch API for authentication. Functionality: Handles OAuth client
credentials flow to get/refresh Twitch app access tokens
(get_app_access_token, get_valid_app_access_token). Converts Twitch
usernames to broadcaster IDs if needed (get_broadcaster_id,
setup_broadcaster_id). Verifies the HMAC SHA256 signature of incoming
Twitch webhook messages (verify_signature), including timestamp
validation for replay attack prevention. Manages EventSub subscriptions:
Retrieves existing subscriptions (get_existing_eventsub_subscriptions).
Creates new subscriptions for specified event types
(create_eventsub_subscription). Deletes subscriptions
(delete_eventsub_subscription). Cleans up invalid or outdated
subscriptions (cleanup_eventsub_subscriptions). Uses a retry mechanism
(utils.retry_on_exception) for API calls. Manages timezone settings for
timestamp operations. Key Technologies: Twitch API, HMAC, SHA256.
bluesky.py:

Role: Handles all interactions with the Bluesky social network.
Functionality: BlueskyPoster class: Logs into Bluesky using provided
credentials. Uploads images to Bluesky for embedding in posts
(upload_image). Formats and posts "stream online" notifications
(post_stream_online) using Jinja2 templates and event data. Supports
image attachments. Formats and posts "stream offline" notifications
(post_stream_offline) using Jinja2 templates. Records all post attempts
(success/failure) to logs/post_history.csv (\_write_post_history).
load_template(): Loads Jinja2 templates from specified paths, with
fallback for errors. Attaches a custom datetimeformat filter. Uses a
retry mechanism for Bluesky API calls. Key Technologies: AT Protocol
(atproto library), Jinja2. tunnel.py:

Role: Manages the execution of the Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared)
client. Functionality: start_tunnel(): Starts the cloudflared process
using the command specified in the TUNNEL_CMD environment variable.
Parses the command using shlex.split and redirects process output.
stop_tunnel(): Terminates the cloudflared process gracefully, with a
fallback to a force kill if needed. Key Technologies: subprocess, shlex.
utils.py:

Role: Provides common utility functions and decorators used across the
application. Functionality: format_datetime_filter(): Jinja2 filter for
formatting ISO datetime strings into localized, human-readable formats.
update_env_file_preserve_comments(): Modifies .env files while keeping
comments and structure. retry_on_exception(): Decorator to automatically
retry functions that raise specified exceptions. generate_secret():
Creates secure random hex strings for secrets. read_env(): Reads
key-value pairs from .env files. rotate_secret_if_needed(): Manages the
automatic rotation of WEBHOOK_SECRET every 30 days or if missing.
is_valid_url(): Basic URL validation. Key Technologies: secrets,
datetime, pytz, tzlocal. 2. Configuration and Settings

settings.env.example:

Role: Template for the settings.env file, which holds all your specific
configurations and secrets. Key Configurations: Twitch:
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID, TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET, TWITCH_BROADCASTER_ID. Bluesky:
BLUESKY_USERNAME, BLUESKY_PASSWORD, BLUESKY_IMAGE_PATH,
BLUESKY_TEMPLATE_PATH, BLUESKY_OFFLINE_TEMPLATE_PATH. Webhook:
WEBHOOK_SECRET (auto-managed), SECRET_LAST_ROTATED (auto-managed),
WEBHOOK_CALLBACK_URL. Discord Notifications: discord_error_notifier_url,
discord_notify_level. General: TIMEZONE, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_RETENTION_DAYS.
Tunnel: TUNNEL_CMD. API Retry: RETRY_MAX, RETRY_WAIT. logging_config.py:

Role: Configures the application's logging system. Functionality: Sets
up an "AuditLogger" for critical audit trails (logs/audit.log). Sets up
an "AppLogger" for general application and error logging: General logs
to logs/app.log. Error-specific logs to logs/error.log. Console output.
All log files use TimedRotatingFileHandler for daily rotation and
configurable retention (LOG_RETENTION_DAYS). Optionally sends error
notifications to Discord via webhook, based on
discord_error_notifier_url and discord_notify_level. Integrates with
Flask's logger if a Flask app instance is provided. Key Libraries:
logging, discord_logging.handler. Cloudflared/config.yml.example:

Role: Example configuration for the cloudflared client. Functionality:
Defines how Cloudflare Tunnel should operate: Specifies tunnel UUID and
credentials file path. Configures ingress rules: routes public hostname
traffic to the local Flask app (port 3000) and returns 404 for other
requests. Includes noTLSVerify: true for the local service, as
Cloudflare handles public TLS. 3. Supporting Files and Directories

This project, "Stream notify on Bluesky," is a well-structured
Python bot designed to automatically notify Bluesky when a specified
Twitch channel goes live or offline. It leverages Twitch's EventSub
system for real-time event detection and Cloudflare Tunnel to receive
these events on a local machine.

Key strengths of the project include:

Modularity: Code is well-organized into distinct modules with clear
responsibilities. Configuration: Extensive configuration options are
available via settings.env. Robustness: Features like API call retries,
webhook signature verification, and detailed logging. Security: Includes
webhook signature verification and secret rotation. GitGuardian is
integrated. Automation: Uses GitHub Actions for CI and pre-commit hooks.
Testing: A good suite of tests is present. Documentation: Comprehensive
documentation in English and Japanese. Containerization: Docker support
simplifies deployment. The application is licensed under GPLv2.

This should provide the complete review again. Please let me know if you
can see it this time or if there's anything else.
